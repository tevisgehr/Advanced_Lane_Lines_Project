# Advanced_Lane_Lines_Project
This project was an expansion on the original lane lines project that I did through Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree. 
- A complete description of techniques used and results obtained are described in Advanced_Lane_Lines_Writeup.pdf. 

- The code and visualizations are included in P3.ipynb.  
  
- The resulting video is in the 'output_videos' folder.
